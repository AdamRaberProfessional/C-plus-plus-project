I didn't put a whole lot of time into this project - only about 20-30 minutes from learning C++ syntax to finishing this
program (the bulk of my programming time has been going towards Viwards). The purpose of this project is to show that I
can pick up languages easily. If I'm required to work on software that's written in a language I'm not familiar with,
I'll be able to research and learn the new syntax and language-specific rules.
