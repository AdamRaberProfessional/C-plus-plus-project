My curriculum leaned more towards Python and away from C++. This is a very simple app, and there would still be a lot for me to learn if I were to start taking C++ seriously. The point of this app is to prove that I won't freeze up if I have to learn a new programming language.

One difference from the video is that I now use ASCII values instead of the list of lowercase letters.
