I didn't put a whole lot of time into this project - only about 20-30 minutes from learning C++ syntax to having this
program. The purpose of this code is not to write some long, complicated program; if I studied up on garbage collection
and C++ concepts, I'm sure I could come up with something good. The purpose of this program is to prove that I can pick
up new languages quickly. You won't have to look at me and think "He doesn't know C-sharp - he's useless to me" -
because I'll be able to learn the basics of any language you throw at me very quickly.
